Trying to create a NLP ML and visualization pipeline that allows definitive identification of seminal papers -- papers that introduce new concepts or terminology that spreads virally. The problem can be explained well by looking at a clear example. "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells" are cells that are reprogrammed from adult cells back to the beginning of life. Before Takahashi, Yamanaka (2006), this protocol and terminology did not exist. However, all of the words in the search phrase, 'Induced', 'pluripotent', 'stem cells', existed before the new concept was born. When you look at a graph of 
"Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells" over time you see a dramatic increase starting just after the original paper in 2006. However, there are ~50 papers/year before 2006 that include each of the words scattered in the abstract. I would like to use NLP to show that iPSC related papers (meaning the Yamanaka fallout) originated specifically from that seminal paper, and that other papers using the same terms, cluster somewhat separately. This would allow a concept to be traced back to the first paper that coined the terminology. A paper that is seminal (originates and idea), and part of a viral spread (idea was rapidly and widely promoted), are works that deserve acclaim. This could be a fun way to study the history of science, tracing the literature back to the most important papers.
